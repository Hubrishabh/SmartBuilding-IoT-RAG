Startup Checklist:
- Verify condenser water pump status and flow.
- Check refrigerant level; inspect for leaks.
- Confirm compressor oil level and differential pressure.

Energy Optimization:
- Run at highest possible chilled-water setpoint that meets comfort.
- Use variable-speed drives to modulate load efficiently.
- Sequence multiple chillers to operate near best COP.
