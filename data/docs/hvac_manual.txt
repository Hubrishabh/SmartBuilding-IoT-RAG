HVAC Maintenance Manual (Excerpt)

Safety Precautions:
- Isolate power before inspection.
- Wear vibration-dampening gloves and hearing protection.
- Confirm lock-out/tag-out procedures.

Vibration Troubleshooting:
- If vibration exceeds 0.7 mm/s, check fan imbalance and misalignment.
- Inspect bearings for wear; re-lubricate according to schedule.
- Tighten mounting bolts; ensure anti-vibration pads are intact.
- Verify rotor cleanliness; remove dust buildup on blades.
- Check belt tension; replace if frayed.

High Temperature Guidance:
- If supply air temperature > 28°C, inspect cooling coil fouling.
- Confirm chilled-water supply temperature is within spec.
- Verify valves and actuators are responsive; recalibrate if needed.
- Inspect and clean air filters; high ∆P indicates clogging.
